# Automatically Scaling Web Applications on Windows Azure Web Sites #

---
<a name="Overview"></a>
## Overview ##

Windows Azure provides a set of features that allows you to monitor and scale your Web Site whenever is required. Moving static assets to a Storage account will leverage the load of your Web Site and with Auto-Scaling, your Windows Azure Web Sites will automatically scale accordingly with their CPU load. Additionally, you can use Endpoint monitoring to measure the response time of your Web site from different locations.

### Exercise 2: Configuring Endpoint Monitoring ###

In this exercise, you will configure endpoint monitoring for your Windows Azure Web Site. Endpoint monitoring configures web tests from geo-distributed locations that test response time and uptime of web URLs. The test performs an HTTP get operation on the web URL to determine the response time and uptime from each location. Each configured location runs a test every five minutes.

> **Note:** Before switching a web site from the free web site mode to the standard web site mode, you must first remove spending caps in place for your Web Site subscription. For more information on shared and standard mode pricing, see [Pricing Details](https://www.windowsazure.com/en-us/pricing/details/).

<a name="Ex2Task1" />

### Exercise 3: Setting up Auto-Scaling for your Site ###

In this exercise, you will enable auto scaling for your Windows Azure Web Site. You can configure the Web site to auto scale when the CPU reaches a target percentage, automatically increasing the instance count. You can configure the minimum and maximum number of instances.

<a name="Ex3Task1" />
#### Task 1 - Enabling Auto-Scaling ####

1. In the Management Portal, go to your Web Site and click **Scale** from the top menu.

1. In order to enable auto-scale, make sure your Web site **mode** is configured as **Standard**.

	![websites-standard-mode](Images/websites-standard-mode.png?raw=true)

1. Go to the **capacity** section and select _CPU_ from the **Autoscale** options. This enables auto scaling using CPU as a target. 

1. From the instance count slider, select the minimum and maximum instances that you want to target for your Web site. Change the target CPU range in order to increase or decrease the number of running instances. This automatically adds or removes an instance when the threshold is reached.

	> **Note:** Windows Azure checks the CPU of your web site once every five minutes and adds instances as needed at that point in time. If CPU usage is low, Windows Azure will remove instances once every two hours to ensure that your website remains performant. Generally, putting the minimum instance count at 1 is appropriate. However, if you have sudden usage spikes on your web site, be sure that you have a sufficient minimum number of instances to handle the load. 

	![websites-automatically-scaling](Images/websites-automatically-scaling.png?raw=true)

	_Automatically scaling your Web Site_

1. Click the **Save** button from the bottom bar to save the settings.
